    "\n",
    "- Form a homework/project group with two of your peers\n",
    "- Your tutor gives you a short introduction into the JuypterLab environment (Launcher, Linux Desktop environment, integration of lecture material into your JupyterLab environment)\n",
    "- Together with your tutor, get in first contact with the Jupyter notebook, the cell handling and the markdown language. Use the notebook [04_Using_the_Jupyter_notebook.ipynb](04_Using_the_Jupyter_notebook.ipynb) as a *very* short reference to the topic. In 2020, Thomas Erben created three videos that explain `Jupyter notebooks` and the `JupyterLab`-environment in more detail. You can watch them in [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FqMC_xCtjRvXC1R55U5ufx0vxajpZqi) if you want to (highly recommended). \n",
    "- Create a new notebook with the name ```Lorentz``` and reproduce this notebook after the heading *Homework Sheet 01*. Please\n",
    "  find the source file for the main code cell in [lorenz.py](code/lorenz.py) in the code directory of this lecture.\n",
    "- There is a [*voluntary* homework sheet on some basic Linux](06_Voluntary_Exercise_Linux.ipynb) that you need to know. As I explained to you in lecture, your group can fail two homework sheets during the term. Doing and passing the Linux sheet, your homework group can fail a third homework sheet during the semester!\n",

    "1. With the Notebook you of course already have the solution of the homework. It is up to you how much you cheat on yourself :-)\n",
    "2. Your tutor will explain to you how to hand-in homework sheets and please use this opportunity to test the submission process with your *Bessel functions* sheet. It will not give you any points though."
