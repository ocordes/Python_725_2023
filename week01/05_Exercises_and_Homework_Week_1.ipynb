    "\n",
    "- Form a homework/project group with two of your peers\n",
    "- Your tutor gives you a short introduction into the JuypterLab environment (Launcher, Linux Desktop environment, integration of lecture material into your JupyterLab environment)\n",
    "- Together with your tutor, get in first contact with the Jupyter notebook, the cell handling and the markdown language. Use the notebook [04_Using_the_Jupyter_notebook.ipynb](04_Using_the_Jupyter_notebook.ipynb) as a *very* short reference to the topic. In 2020, I created three videos that explain `Jupyter notebooks` and the `JupyterLab`-environment in more detail. You can watch them in [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FqMC_xCtjRvXC1R55U5ufx0vxajpZqi) if you want to (highly recommended). \n",
    "- Create a new notebook with the name ```Bessel_Functions``` and reproduce this notebook after the heading *Homework Sheet 01*. Please\n",
    "  find source files for the code cells in [bessel_asymp.py](code/bessel_asymp.py) and [bessel_recursion.py](code/bessel_recursion.py) in the code directory of this lecture.\n",
    "- There is a [*voluntary* homework sheet on some basic Linux](06_Voluntary_Exercise_Linux.ipynb) that you need to know. As I explained to you in lecture, your group can fail two homework sheets during the term. Doing and passing the Linux sheet, your homework group can fail a third homework sheet during the semester!\n",

    "**Notes:**\n",
    "1. With the Notebook you of course already have the solution of the homework. It is up to you how much you cheat on yourself :-)\n",
    "2. Your tutor will explain to you how to hand-in homework sheets and please use this opportunity to test the submission process with your *Bessel functions* sheet. It will not give you any points though."
